### NewMemberShowResponse

`func NewMemberShowResponse(member NullableMember, ) *MemberShowResponse`

NewMemberShowResponse instantiates a new MemberShowResponse object

and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewMemberShowResponseWithDefaults

`func NewMemberShowResponseWithDefaults() *MemberShowResponse`

This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetMember

`func (o *MemberShowResponse) GetMember() Member`

GetMember returns the Member field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetMemberOk

and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetMember

`func (o *MemberShowResponse) SetMember(v Member)`

SetMember sets Member field to given value.


### SetMemberNil

`func (o *MemberShowResponse) SetMemberNil(b bool)`
